New look for the black and gray knobs

A small tweak on the FX knobs

TriggersMKIII textfields updated to V2 code(was missing from the V2.0.0 update, and crashing rack when present on a patch)

Delay Plus Stereo FX: Added a Clear Buffer switch and CV input for each channel (long time request)

Also added input, output and switches tip labels for this two modules, the rest will come later

### V 2.0.0 update for compatibility with VCV RACK V2

Graphics and code updated to work with V2

### V 1.0.5 update, final update for V1 plugin

ZCV2T Zero crossing CV to Trigger module, anlexmatos made the update to support CV polyphony

Super Drive FX Stereo module added

WaveShaper module: CV inputs to control shape and scale added, wave mod input added.

WaveShaper FX Stereo module added, same features as WaveShaper, but stereo.


### V 1.0.2 update

More graphic updates.

Now every knob tooltip shows the proper parameter value according to it's function.

BPM Clock got the BPM range switch removed to work ok with the tooltips, 30-300 BPM is now the default range. (Your old patches using BPM Clock will need to adjust the BPM setting).

### V 1.0.1 update

Small graphic refresh/fixes, output ports on every module are now gold colored to make easier to find them

### ADSR
Fundamental ADSR module. Mods: graphics, sliders instead of knobs to provide faster visual input.

### VCA
Fundamental VCA module. Mods: graphics, sliders instead of knobs to provide faster visual input, one input + lin/exp switch instead of two separate inputs.

V 0.5.3: Code fix, now the VCA module works ok when there's no envelope input present.

V 0.6.2: Small fix on the reset signal length.

V 0.6.5: Added a Regular/Extended switch to change the clock from 40-250 to 30-300 range. Had to add the switch instead of simply changing the default settings to avoid changing the bpm tempo on the patches already using the clock.

V 0.6.6: Added a CV input for the "RUN" switch.

V 0.6.7: Added a CV output for the "RUN" switch, sends a trigger signal on each press of the switch.

### Multi 2x5
2x5 Signal multiplier.

V 0.5.7 Module size reduced to 5HP

V 0.6.13 New feature: If the input 2 is not active the second row of outputs takes the value of input 1 so the module becomes a multi 1 x 10, nice and simple idea! requested by MarcBroule.

2x5 CV Signal merger.

V 0.5.7: First release of this module.

V 1.0.2 New feature: If the output 2 is not active the output 1 sums up the values of the second row of inputs too, so the module becomes a merge 10 x 1.
