# AS modules

### ADSR
Fundamental ADSR module. Mods: graphics, sliders instead of knobs to provide faster visual input.

### VCA
Fundamental VCA module. Mods: graphics, sliders instead of knobs to provide faster visual input, one input + lin/exp switch instead of two separate inputs.

V 0.5.3: Code fix, now the VCA module works ok when there's no envelope input present.

### QuadVCA/Mixer
AS VCA module x 4, plus mixer functionality (user request).

V 0.5.5: First relase of this module.

### BPM Clock
Strum's Mental VCV Master Clock. Mods: graphics, reset trigger input and output.

V 0.5.2: all the trigger signals are 10v now, it seems that some other modules don't work fine with the correct voltages.

V 0.5.4: Fixed a reset signal issue.

V 0.5.5: 16th clock output now sends unipolar signal, just as the other outputs.

V 0.6.1: Now BPM Clock outputs a short length trigger signal, as most of the available clocks.

V 0.6.2: Small fix on the reset signal length.

V 0.6.5: Added a Regular/Extended switch to change the clock from 40-250 to 30-300 range. Had to add the switch instead of simply changing the default settings to avoid changing the bpm tempo on the patches already using the clock.

V 0.6.6: Added a CV input for the "RUN" switch.

V 0.6.7: Added a CV output for the "RUN" switch, sends a trigger signal on each press of the switch.

A BPM to delay/hz calculator to setup easier those nice delay effects.

V 0.6.4: First relase of this module.

V 0.6.5: Added an external input to detect a BPM from a LFO or some other sources, BPM detection code based on Koralfx Beatovnik from Tomek Sosnowski, nice work Tomek!.

### 8 Channel Mixer
Fundamental/Autodafe mixer module. Mods: graphics, sliders for channel volume, stereo or mono output(L channel outputs L+R signal if R channel is not active). Now with main mix mute button. Beware,the default setting for each channel volume is at 70% in stead of 0%.

V 0.5.2: added MIX L & R input to chain mixers without giving up 2 mixer channels.

### Triggers REMOVED
A couple of manual trigger buttons, one ON/OFF, one temporary, both with 4 trigger outputs, trigger volts knob going from 1 to 10 v output.

(NOTICE: Triggers MKI will supersede Triggers, so Triggers will be removed from the plugin by v0.6 but you have time now to replace it on your current patches and keep everything working fine).

    "------", "MUTE","  SOLO"," RESET"," DRUMS","  KICK"," SNARE"," HIHAT","  CLAP","  PERC","BASS 1","BASS 2"," GTR 1",
    " GTR 2","LEAD 1","LEAD 2"," PAD 1"," PAD 2","CHORDS","  FX 1","  FX 2"," SEQ 1"," SEQ 2"," MIX 1"," MIX 2",    
    " AUX 1"," AUX 2","    ON","   OFF"," START","  STOP"," PAUSE","    UP","  DOWN","  LEFT"," RIGHT", "RUN"
